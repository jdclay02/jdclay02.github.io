      </p>
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>
        The crews main weaknesses are their small numbers, which allow them to be easily overwhelmed
        by large groups. The crews second main weakness is their recklessness, which leads them to
        split into smaller groups, and get overwhelmed.
