        also has a secondary dream to defeat the man who killed his old crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in the Briss Kingdom in the South Blue, he was hired as an assistant Navigator on a
        pirate crew when he was nineteen. This crew was first defeated by a Marine Captain when
        he was twenty one as they had attempted to head into the Grand Line. Three years later that
        same Captain, now a Commodore, destroyed Archies old crew and captured the Captain and
        Primary Navigator. Archie spent the next year in hiding, until being recruited to the New
        Game Pirates by Keek Frip.
      </p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Archie had naturally blond hair, which he dyes a bright green in memory of his old captain
        who had naturally green hair and blue eyes, which he hides with golden contacts lenses. He
        prefers to wear a black and white three piece suit, with a vest instead of a jackm, with a
        longer coat over it. He also wears a black fedora with the rest of his outfit.
      </p>
      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Archie is a cautions and patient individual who prefers to stay in the back during fights,
        and can come off as being callous to others. He enjoys spending time talking with interesting
        people, and listening to his crew. He holds great loyalty to his current and former crews, he
        held a great deal of Respect for his old captains, Maxwell and Keek Frip. He is very loyal to
        his current Captain, Chad. Archie has respect for people who think for themselves and dislikes
        it when people follow orders they disagree with without questioning them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Archie can come off as callous to people who don't know him, as he doesn't have a problem
        with killing anyone who fights against his crew.
      </p>
      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Keek Frip</h3>
      <p>
        Archie held a great deal of respect for his second Captain, who invited him to his second
        crew, and helped him get over his depression after losing his first crew. Archie prefered to
        defer to his Captain's ideas and orders, as he usually agreed with him. Archie also valued
        Keek as a calming presence when Archie wanted to be ruthless.
      </p>
      <h3>Chad Man</h3>
      <p>
        Archie respected Chad as a skilled Shipwright, and became friends with him after joining the
        New Game Pirates. Archie viewed Chad as a skilled and dependable ally and friend, and tended
        to work well with him, as he helped distract targets so Archie could get sneak attack in.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the death of Keek, Archie voted for Chad to become the new Captain.
      </p>
      <h3>Suresh Wanty</h3>
      <p>
        Archie respected Suresh as a Shipwright, and found it fun to mess with him by taking his
        alcohol. During the Scraptrap Arc, Archie ran into the line of fire to draw fire away from him
        after Sanjo and Keek went down. Archie gained a lot more respect for Suresh after seeing him
        survive over twenty bullets getting shot into him.
      </p>
      <h3>Sanjo</h3>
      <p>
        Archie and Sanjo are business partners, with Archie running the finances while Sanjo used his
        expert cooking to make food. Archie and Sanjo have opposite personalities, with Sanjo being
        reckless where Archie is patient. Archie and Sanjo get along for the most part, though Archie
        tends to get frustrated with Sanjo.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the death of Captain Keek, Archie's relationship with Sanjo was strained.
      </p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Past</h3>
      <p>
        Archie was born in the Briss Kingdom, where he lived until he was nineteen. While living in
        the kingdom, he studied at the Naval Academy until he met his first captain, Maxwell, and
        joined him in being a pirate.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Archie was twenty-one, the crew made their first attempt to enter the grand line, where
        they were beaten down by a marine captain, however they managed to escape with no casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Archie was twenty-four, his crew attempted to raid a Marine Base, hoping to take revenge
        on the Marine Captain. However, they failed and the Captain who origionally defeated them had
        been promotted to Commodore and he destroyed Archies old crew, as well as captured Maxwell and
        the Navigator.
      </p>
      <h3>Cresent Moon Island</h3>
      <p>
        Archie was recruited to what would become the New Game Pirates in the City of Pantherport
        on Cresent Moon Island. They at first looked for ships in the city, but could only find
        fishing boats, so they attempted to leave and go to Rivermouth. On the way, they were attacked
        by panthers, and after defeating them, they were asked by the Mayor to deal with them for pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Archie hid in the tree's while the crew found and confronted the Pantherman, and Archie nearly
        shot the Pantherman, but allowed the captain, Keek Frip to negotiate. They crew brought him
        back to Pantherport, where Pantherman was arrested, and the crew fled after accidentaly
        starting a war. Outside of town, they met a child, who they would later learn was Isaac,
        the Second Prince of the Island. Isaac payed them 500,000 for let him pal around with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crew arrived in Rivermouth, and Archie joined Chad and Keek Frip in heading to the docks
        to find a ship. They eventually found one, the Whispered Vesper, which they arranged to buy
        for $4,000,000 beli. Afterwords, the three went to the Tavern to meet back up with Suresh and
        Sanjo. At the Tavern, Archie attempted to steal Suresh's vodka, but failed. They crew met a
        Marine who hired them to look into Long Jack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crew headed into the Jungle, where Archie successfuly led them past the initial guards,
        until Suresh sneezed, and alerted a diffrent group of guards. Keek and Suresh were knocked
        unconsious, while Chad, Sanjo and Isaac were captured. Archie avoided capture by hiding in
        a tree. The crew would later meet with Long Jack, and agree to steal back a treasure he had
        sold to the royal family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crew was released, and they informed the Marines of Long Jack for the money. They then
        broke into the castle with the help of the Prince, and with his knowledge, they told the
        treasure, which turned out to be a Devil Fruit. The Crew would use the Box and their
        accumulated funds to buy a boat and leave.
      </p>
      <h3>Coliseum island Arc</h3>
      <p>
        After two weeks of Travel, the crew arrived on Coliseum Island, fleeing from Long Jack after
        breaking their deal with him. They agreed to participate in Coliseum Challenges to make back
        some money, as theirs was depleated. During their second Challenge, Archie accidentaly killed
        a man by shooting him in the head. In their third challenge, Keek and Chad were knocked out.
      </p>
      <p>
        After making it to the middle class challenges, the crew went to look for the devil fruit
        encyclopedia, and found a man who had consumed the Nightmare Devil Fruit. After braving their
        fears, they met with him, and gave him ideas on how to train and control his powers, and in
        exchange, got the book, where they identified the Devil Fruit they possessed, the Nagi Nagi no
        Mi, or the Calm Calm Fruit. Archie would be given the Fruit, as it suited his fighting style
        the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        During their time on the Coliseum island, they would also meet another competitor, who seemed
        to possess a skill based Devil Fruit, as she gave Archie the ability to Juggle. After making
        it to High Class, the crew visited a store, where Archie bought a Wazamono-Grade Rapier, named
        the Kaiyonami, and upgraded his Armor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two weeks after arriving on the island, the island was attacked by Long Jack. As the crew fled
        they were faced with the Gunsmith who had ratted them out to Long Jack the first time, and
        the crew defeated him and the group of pirates he was leading. After defeating him, Archie
        shot him in the head while the rest of the crew, and took his custom double-shot rifle. The
        crew would flee the Island.
      </p>
      <h3>Undermountain Arc</h3>
      <p>
        Archie would lead the Crew away from Coliseum Island, and they would eventually arrive on
        an uncharted island, where they would get dragged down by a whirl pool. While Archie managed
        to stay on the ship, Keek and Sanjo were knocked off. Eventually, the remaining crew found a
        small town, and Archie decided to stay back while Chad and Suresh explored the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        After signing up with a mining crew, Chad and Suresh got Archie, so they could look for Keek
        and Sanjo. The three decided to ignore they job they had signed up for, and hunted them down
        by themselves. After being attacked by Spiders, they found a train, which eventually lead them
        to a smaller mining outpost they had visited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chad and Suresh were found by Steve the Miner they had signed up with, who led them to Keek
        and Sanjo. After the crew united, they met the Vibing Pirates who had allied with Keek and
        Sanjo in the underground forest. The Crew would agree to take Steve and fifty others to the
        surface, in exchange for their help in leaving the underground.
      </p>
      <p>
        While preparing to leave, Archie was in charge of getting food, so he robbed a bakery, and
        to cause a distraction, lit a match and tossed it in to blow it up. He would arrive back at
        the ship and load his bread aboard while Keek and Suresh returned with the dingy that had been
        stolen from them by the fishermen. The crew would scout out the tunnels before returning
        to pick up Steve and his Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        While picking up Steve and his Group, Archie would Man the Cannons, and shoot groups of
        soldiers who tried to prevent Steve's group from leaving. After Steve's Group was on the ship
        Archie navigated the ship away from the city, and towards the elevator, which they would
        use to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        After arriving at the surface, the crew would part with the Vibing Pirates and Steve's Miners
        who started to build a new town on the uninhabited island. As they were leaving, they decided
        to head to the Grand Line, and they learned that Long Jack was preventing all pirate crews
        from heading to the Grand Line until they were caught and brought to him.
      </p>
      <h3>Scraptrap Arc</h3>
      <p>
        As the crew headed towards Scraptrap, the island closes to Reverse Mountain, to get a Log Pose
        and a Den Den Mushi. They were attacked by two sea kings, and the crew killed them without
        much difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they arrived on the island, they payed there way onto the island, and they headed to a bar
        where they learned that Log Poses were being restricted. The Crew met the Marine Captain,
        Captain Who, who had memory problems. After Chad and Suresh left the bar, Archie, Keek and
        Sanjo went to purchase a Den Den Mushi, and they bought two.
      </p>
      <p>
        After meeting back up with Suresh, they went to look for Chad, and Sanjo was recognized. After
        some quick talking by Suresh, the Marines left Sanjo alone, and Archie begged Sanjo to be more
        discrete. After a few hours, they got a lead on Chad's location, and followed a tunnel to his
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        One the crew arrived, Archie tried to scout, but Sanjo jumped the fence into an ambush. Archie
        took out the snipers, and the crew was wounded. Sanjo then charged into the Factory, and
        Archie hid in the back to provide supporting cover. Eventually, Keek and Sanjo both went down,
        and Suresh was heavily injured, so Archie broke his cover to draw fire from the Snipers so
        Suresh wouldn't get targeted. This worked, and after the second group was defeated, Sanjo was
        woken up, but Keek was found to be dead. Archie called for a retreat, with Suresh picking up
        Keek's body, and Archie blowing up the factory.
