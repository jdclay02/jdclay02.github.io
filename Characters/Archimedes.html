      <p>
        <b>Archimedes Johannson</b>, also known as <b>Archie</b> is the Navigator of the New Game
        Pirates, as well as their Sniper. His Dream is to visit every island in the world, and he
        also has a secondary dream to defeat the man who killed his old crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in the Briss Kingdom in the South Blue, he was hired as an assistant Navigator on a
        pirate crew when he was nineteen. This crew was first defeated by a Marine Captain when
        he was twenty one and they attempted to head into the Grand Line. Three years later that
        same Captain, now a Commodore, destroyed Archies old crew, and captured the Captain and
        Primary Navigator. Archie spent the next year in hiding
      </p>

        held a great deal of Respect for his old captains, Maxwell and Keek Frip. He is very loyal to
        his current Captain, Chad. Archie has respect for people who think for themselves and dislikes
        it when people follow orders they disagree with without questioning them.
      </p>
      <p>

        been promotted to Commodore and he destroyed Archies old crew, as well as captured Maxwell and
