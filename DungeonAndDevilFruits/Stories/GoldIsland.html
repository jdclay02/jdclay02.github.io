      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Band of Thieves</h3>
      <p>
        The Straw Hat's have lunch, cooked by Charles. While not particularly good, it is 
        edible. Luffy designs a flag for the ship, which doesn't look that good, so Usopp 
        takes a crack at it, first designing aa flag for himself before designed a good 
        looking Flag for the Straw Hat Pirates. As the crew is cleaning up, they are 
        attacked by the Hyena brothers, who are pushed off the ship. Eldoraggo then appears, 
        and capsizes the Merry with a scream.
      </p>
      <!--
        Xp: +10, Luffy: 1670, Zoro: 1305, Nami: 435, Samuel: 1565, Charles: 995, Usopp: 360, 
        Kaya: 10
      -->
      <p>
        Usopp, Kaya and Nami are swept away, while Chales rescues Samuel, and Zoro rescues 
        Luffy and Tobio. Luffy's group come upon a floating Oden cart run by Tobio's 
        Grandfather, which they eat at. From Ganzo, they learn about Woonan and his treasure. 
        When Ganzo tries to get the Straw Hats to pay, they flee.
      </p>
      <h3>The Isle of Gold</h3>
      <p>
        Nami's group are captured along with the Merry by Eldoraggo after landing on the Isle 
        of Gold. Usopp offers to decipher the map to protect the crew, which Eldoraggo 
        accepts. They eventually reach a castle where the treasure is supposedly buried. 
        When Eldoraggo starts using his power to destroy the surrounding area. The noise 
        from this alerts Luffy's group, which allows them to find the rest of the crew. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Luffy and Zoro distract Eldoraggo and Golass while Samuel and Charles rescue the 
        crew and retreat. Luffy and Zoro are also forced to retreat, primarily to lead 
        their opponents away from the crew. With the crew rescued, they reunite on a hill 
        and check over the stolen map. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Following an initially misinterpereted clue, leads them to a Plateau where they 
        meet back up with Tobio. Scaling the cliff, they locate Woonan's cave, and find 
        Ganzo there. From Ganzo, they learn the story of Woonan. Climbing up the rest of the 
        way, they find an isolated Hut, and are attacked by Eldoraggo.
      </p>
      <h3>The Screaming Pirates</h3>
      <p>
        Luffy faces off against Eldoraggo, while Zoro faces Golass, and the rest of the Straw 
        Hats take on the other members of the Screaming Pirates.
      </p>
      <!--

      -->
      <p>
        With the Screaming Pirates defeated, they meet back up with Ganzo and Tobio, and 
        discover the Treasure of Woonan, his deathbed letter to Ganzo. With the mystery 
        solved, the Straw Hat's depart the island, but not before looting Eldoraggo's ship.
