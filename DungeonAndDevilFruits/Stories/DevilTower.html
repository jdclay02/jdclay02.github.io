      <h3>Attack of the Plesiosaur</h3>
      <p>
        The Straw Hat Pirates are traveling towards the Gecko Islands on their way to 
        Loguetown, when they are attacked by a Plesiosaur. The five pirates manage to fight 
        off the sea-dwelling dinosaur, however it manages to kidnap Nami as it escapes.
      </p>
      <!--Xp: +50, Luffy: 750, Zoro: 700, Nami: 150, Samuel: 600, Charles: 400-->
      <p>
        Not willing to let the beast take their crewmate, the four remaining Straw Hats give 
        chase, and follow the beast to a nearby island. Beaching their ship, they are 
        confronted by two Pirates that Samuel recognizes as part of Ganzack's crew, a pirate 
        with a bounty of $10,000,000. The Four take out the two pirates and meet Medaka, a 
        local girl.
      </p>
      <!--Xp: +10, Luffy: 760, Zoro: 710, Nami: 150, Samuel: 610, Charles: 410-->
      <p>
        At the village, the Straw Hats are introduced to Medaka's grandfatherm Skid. Skid 
        tells of the Pirate Ganzack and his enslaving of the island. After a minor 
        earthquake disturbs Luffy's meal, the crew head to the tower to rescue Nami.
      </p>
      <h3>The Devil's Tower</h3>
      <p>
        The crew break into the tower with Medaka, and locate an Armory. The Avery Brothers 
        use the opporunity to gear up, picking up some new armor and weapons. Heading deeper 
        into the tower, they locate Medaka's father, Herring. Medaka reveals the crew, 
        leading to a fight. During the fight, Medaka is kidnapped by a masked figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luffy leaves to chase after Medaka, while the rest of the crew fight against the 
        Ganzack pirates, only being subdued after they threaten to fire on the slaves. 
        Meanwhile, Luffy fights Ganzack and his Plesiosaur, and is an even match for them 
        until he is captured in Foam.
      </p>
      <!--Xp:, Luffy: 810, Zoro: 810, Nami: 150, Samuel: 710, Charles: 510-->
      <p>
        Captured, the Straw Hats are forced to watch as the Ganzack pirates eat and party. 
        When an explosion caused by Herring rocks the tower, Samuel escapes and he and Nami 
        free the crew. Rushing down the tower, the crew interrupt the Execution of Herring 
        and start beating down the Ganzack Pirates. 
      </p>
      <!--Xp:, Luffy: 860, Zoro: 860, Nami: 200, Samuel: 760, Charles: 560-->
      <p>
        Ganzack calls for a retreat, and his Plesiosaur pulls the Devil Tower away from the 
        island. The Straw Hat's give chase, with Luffy and Samuel pulling themselves as well 
        as Zoro and Charles towards Ganzack's ship. Aboard, Luffy defeats Ganzack, Zoro 
        defeat's Ganzack's first mate, Samuel defeats the Plesiosaur, and Samuel defeats the 
        remaining crew.
      </p>
