      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>The Bounty Hunters</h3>
      <p>
        Usopp and Luffy test out the new Cannons and Cannonballs gained from the Screaming 
        pirates. While testing the Cannon, they break apart a rock and find Johnny and 
        Yosaku, two bounty hunters who used to work with Zoro. Taking the bounty hunters 
        aboard, Kaya diagnoses Yosaku with Scurvy, and works to cure him. Once the two are 
        feeling better, they mention the Baratie, the Sea Restaurant.
      </p>
      <h3>The Floating Resturaut</h3>
      <p>
        As the crew arrive at the Baratie, they are fired upon by a Marine ship, which Luffy 
        bounces back, sinking the ship. The crew enter the resturaut, and are waited upon 
        by Sanji, until Marine Lieutenant Fullbody arrives and tries to pick a fight with 
        Luffy. Luffy scares away the Marine with Conquerer's Haki, making Zeff take notice 
        of the young crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the crew are eating, Gin arrives and is fed by Sanji. Luffy decides he want's 
        to recruit Sanji to the crew. Enjoying the food, the crew agree to stay and wait.
      </p>
      <h3>The Black Blade</h3>
      <p>
        Two days later, the crew find Nami and the Merry missing. There is a flashback to 
        Samuel confronting Nami before dawn, where they play the Drinking Question Game, 
        Nami will stay if Samuel wins, but Samuel won't stand in her way if she wins. Nami 
        wins with her last question being that Samuel already knew about her situation with 
        Arlong. Samuel drinks, and tells her that he's known for over ten years, confusing 
        her. Samuel promises Nami that should she need help, the crew will be there for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don Krieg arrives and demands food. Zeff provides it, and Krieg tries to take over 
        the restaurant. Mihawk arrives and destroys Krieg's ship. Zoro challenges Mihawk to 
        a duel, which is accepted. Mihawk initially unsheathes Kogatama, but switches to 
        Yoru after sensing that Zoro possesses Haki. Mihawk wins the duel, but allows Zoro 
        to live after impressing him, and tells Zoro to come find him when he is stronger.

        Krieg and six of his crew while Samuel takes out Pearl and 20 of his crew by 
        shifting into his elemental form. Meanwhile, Sanji defeats Gin.
