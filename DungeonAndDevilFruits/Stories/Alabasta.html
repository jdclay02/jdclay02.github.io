      <h3>The Okama, The Pirate and The Revolutionary</h3>
      <p>
        The crew run into Bon Kurei on the way to Alabasta. He steals the faces of most of the 
        crew, minus Sanji, Vivi and Samuel. Samuel recognizes his fruit as formerly belonging to 
        Kurozumi Higurashi. Samuel calls him out for being a member of Baroque Works, and offers 
        for him to defect. He considers it, but is forced to decline, as he gave his word.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crew arrives in Nanohana, and Luffy rushes off after sensing Ace. Samuel follows after 
        him, and watches the confrontation between Ace, Luffy and Smoker. Samuel watches the 
        brothers play with Smoker, with Ace commenting on Luffy's use of Haki. After Smoker is 
        defeated, the crew meet back on on the Going Merry, and are introduced to Ace. Ace offers 
        Luffy to become a subordinate of Whitebeard, which is refused. Samuel speaks up, and 
        suggests an Alliance, as Whitebeard has no intrest in the One Piece, which Ace refutes. 
        Samuel counters that Whitebeard knows how to get to Laugh Tale, and just hasn't. Ace calls 
        Whitebeard, who approves the Alliance, and his lack in intrest in the One Piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just after the crew hangs up, Sabo asks for permission to come aboard. Ace and Luffy freak 
        out, as he is alive. Sabo introduces his companions, Koala and Hack. Sabo also outs Samuel 
        as being from another world with knowledge of the Future. Samuel defends himself, and Sanji 
        sticks up for him, as Luffy would not want spoilers, to which the captain agrees. Vivi 
        sends a message with Karoo, and convinces Ace and Sabo to help free her country.
      </p>

        and meet with Kohza on Vivi's behalf. Vivi gratefully accepts. Ace decides to stick with 
        Sabo so they can catch up more.

        with Tashigi to rescue the crew and Smoker from Crocodile, who has betrayed the World

        location of Crocodiles backup bomb.

        Ace, Sabo, Koala and Hack meet with Kohza and the other Rebel leaders, and inform them

        relieved to hear that Cobra is innocent.
