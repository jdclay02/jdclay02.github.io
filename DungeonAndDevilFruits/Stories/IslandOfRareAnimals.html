      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>The Brother's Arrival</h3>
      <p>
        Brothers Samuel and Charles Avery awaken on a mysterious island, with Charles blaming 
        Samuel for their situation. There is a flashback showing how they got to the island, 
        Samuel met an Isekai Fairy who sent the two Brothers to the Island of Rare Animals 
        in the East Blue after Sam rolled on several tables. It is revealed that Sam chose 
        to bring along Charles due to him being dissatisfied with his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        After their argument, the two brothers take stock of their situation, and it is 
        revealed that Samuel has an instructive guide to haki written by Silvers Rayleigh,
        while Charles has a devil fruit. After Sam explains how devil fruits work, Charles 
        decides that he doesn't want it, as losing the abilitiy to swim in a world of water
        seems to be a bad idea. Samuel finds the additional power gained from a devil fruit 
        an acceptable trade, and consumes it with Charles's permission. It is revealed to be 
        the Mori Mori no Mi, the Forest Logia that was origionally consumed by Aramaki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After taking stock of their situation, the brothers team up to explore the Island. 
        While exploring, they encounter a grove of fruit tree's, and are attacked by Gaimon 
        while collecting some of the fruit. The bullet passses through Samuel, and it is 
        revealed that he possesses Observation Haki. The brother's reveal Gaimon's location, 
        and talk him down.
      </p>
      <h3>The Pirates Arrive</h3>
      <p>
        A few days after arriving on the island, Samuel and Charles are sparing. Samuel is 
        practicing using his logia abilities, while Charles is practicing using Armament to 
        coat his weapon and strike Logia's. While they are sparing, Gaimon rushes over and 
        informs the two that Pirates have arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Samuel, Charles and Gaimon watch the pirates disembark, and overhear the captain 
        loudly complaining about the broken keel on the ship. The First Mate brings up their 
        current location, and about the supposed treasure. The captain gives orders to find 
        the treasure and kill all who stand in their way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first mate leads half the crew, five men into the forest. Gaimon runs his 
        guardian of the forest routine, but the pirates are unaffected. Samuel drags one of 
        the pirates into the forest and kills him with his logia powers, freaking out the 
        pirates. Samuel entangles the pirates, allowing Charles to suprise them, and defeat 
        a few more. Samuel drags off another pirate, leaving just the First Mate, who is on 
        the verge of a mental breakdown. Charles reveals himself, and reveals his Conqueror's 
        Haki, and terrifies the first mate, who tries to run, but is killed by Samuel.
      </p>
      <!--Xp: +50 Samuel, +275 Charles-->
      <p>
        Samuel, Charles and Gaimon return to be beach and watch the pirates continue to 
        unload their ship. Gaimon tries his guardian of the forest act again, and gets a 
        bullet shot at him in responce. Sam entangles the pirates while Charles charges at 
        them. The duo take advantage of their suprise attack to take out two of the pirates, 
        while the others are distracted. As the remaining pirates start fighting against the 
        brothers, Charles fights the crew, while Samuel enters his Elemental Form and fights 
        against the captain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charles is able to take out the three crew members he is fighting against by 
        overpowering their strikes with his haki-infused cutlass, while their captain is 
        frustrated with Samuel's elemental form being immune to his attacks. When the Captain 
        threatens to burn down the island, he is killed by Samuel.
      </p>
      <!--Xp: +500 Samuel: 550 Total, +75 Charles: 350 Total-->
      <h3>The Straw Hat Pirates</h3>
      <p>
        About a week after the attack of the pirates, the island trio have fully explored and 
        looted the ship they came on, and found that it was irreparable. In the meantime, 
        the brothers have kept up their training, with Charles now fully understanding how 
        to user weapon hardening, and Samuel being able to better control his plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaimon inform the brothers about two ships which are approaching the island, and the 
        brothers join him in watching them approach. Samuel is able to instantly recognize 
        Luffy and Nami on the ship. As the duo approach, Gaimon runs his Guardian of the 
        Forest routine, which the two Straw Hats are unimpressed by. Gaimon attempts to shoot 
        Luffy, but it fails due to his rubber body. Before things can escalate further, 
        Samuel reveals himself and starts talking to Luffy and Nami, offering food.
      </p>
      <p>
        The island trio and the Straw Hats eat lunch together, and Samuel offer to play a 
        game with Luffy to win free passage to Loguetown. Luffy agrees. The game is to guess 
        something about the other person, if you are right, they drink and you make another 
        guess, if you are wrong, you drink, and switch questioner. Luffy begins:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Your Devil Fruit is a Paramecia: Wrong</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Samuel wins free passage for himself and his brother. Luffy want's to play again, due 
        to only being able to ask two questions. Samuel agrees, they are playing for Sam and 
        Charles to join the crew. Samuel starts.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Due to Luffy winning, Samuel agrees to join the crew, and Charles asks Luffy if he 
        can join as well, which he accepts. With lunch done, Samuel and Charles load supplies 
        onto Nami's boat, and board Luffy's raft as they set off.
