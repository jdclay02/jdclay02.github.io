      <hr />
      <p>
        The <b>Syrup Village Arc</b> is the third arc in the East Blue Saga of Dungeons and 
        Devil Fruits. The Straw Hats arrive at Syrup village, and meet Usopp. Through Usopp 
        they meet Kaya, and try to get a ship from her.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <!--Xp:, Luffy: 1310, Zoro: 1060, Nami: 300, Samuel: 1210, Charles: 760-->
      <h3>The Son of Yasopp</h3>
      <p>
        The Straw Hat Pirate arrive in Syrup Village, and meet Usopp, the town liar. Through 
        Usopp, they meet the Usopp Pirates, and learn about Kaya. Going to visit Kaya, they 
        meet her as well as her butlers Klahadore and Merry. When Klahadore tried to get 
        Usopp and the crew to leave, he calls Usopp's father a pathetic pirate, which causes 
        Samuel to burst out laughing, and inform everyone that Usopp's father is 'Chaser' 
        Yasopp, one of the Commanders of the 'Red Hair' Yonko Fleet, with a bounty over 1 
        billion berry.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving the Manor, the crew runs into Jango, who's power knocks out all but 
        Zoro and Chanles, who fake falling asleep until Jango is out of sight. After waking 
        up the rest of the crew, Luffy, Usopp and Charles went after Jango while Samuel, 
        Nami and Zoro went into town to pick up some supplies.
      </p>
      <h3>The Black Cat Pirates</h3>
      <p>
        That Night, the crew meets up to discuss what they learned and agree to assist Usopp 
        with protecting the village. Usopp plans to trap the beach, and Samuel suggests the 
        other beach to be more likely, which Nami agree's with. They trap the beach and move 
        Nami's ship. While the crew does this, Samuel teaches Usopp the basics of Haki.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Black Cat Pirates arrive, and are defeated by the crew and Usopp. Jango is 
        forced to summon Sham and Buchi, who are engaged by Zoro and Charles respectivly. 
        Samuel goes up against Jango while Nami breaks into the Bezen Black and loots it.

        When Khaladore, now revealed to be Kuro of a Thousand Plans, he finds that his 
        entire crew has been defeated, and is brought into conflict with Luffy. Kaya 
        arrives, and is protected by Usopp while Luffy defeats Kuro.

      <h3>A Real Pirate</h3>
      <p>
        The crew follows Usopp and Kaya back to her Manor, where they check on a recovering 
        Merry. While checking on Kaya, Samuel locates her 'Medicine' which he notices it 
        actually Rat Poison. Samuel brings this up to Kaya, who is pissed off. Later, when 
        Kaya gives the Merry to the Crew, and Luffy invites Usopp, Kaya requests to join as 
        well, which Luffy accepts.
