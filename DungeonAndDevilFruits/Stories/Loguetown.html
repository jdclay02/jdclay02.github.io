        Makino is happy for Luffy. Mihawk meets with Shanks, and shows him Luffy's bounty.
      </p>
      <h3>The Town of the Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        The crews arrive in Loguetown. Samuel gives the Devil Pirates some money for they 
        can go an buy a ship. Samuel and Sanji leave to go an procure supplies while the 
        rest of the crew split up to go off on their own. While they are buying food, Sanji 
        notices Samuel signaling one of the merchants. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Zoro and Charles head to a weapon shop to get new swords, when they come across and 
        help Tashigi. Zoro recieves the Sandai and Yubashiri, while Charles gets a normal 
        sword. Meanwhile, Nami, Nojiko and Kaya shop for new clothes, looking for things that 
        will be durable enough for the grand line. Usopp gets some new goggles and searches 
        for a Den Den Mushi at the request of Samuel. Johnny and Yosaku guard the ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Samuel gets contacted, and takes Sanji to a bar. There, they meet Bello Betty and 
        Monkey D. Dragon of the Revolutionary Army. Samuel enters negotiations with Dragon 
        for two things, the first is for Chief of Staff Sabo to meet with the Straw Hat crew 
        at Alabasta, and the second is for the Den Den Mushi number of Jaguar D. Saul. 
        Dragon asks what's in it for him, and Samuel jokes that it's to help his son, which 
        is true, before stating that it will get Sabo's memories back. Samuel also offers a 
        few pieces of information in exchange.
      </p>
      <details class="spoiler" style="--hidden: 'Text to be hidden'">
        <summary>
          Samuel's Offered information
        </summary>
        <li>
          1: Imu Nerona is still alive and rules the World Government. The Gorosei answer to 
          them.
        </li>
        <li>

      </details>
      <p>
        Dragon accepts the information, and asks Samuel if he is a time traveler or a 
        dimension hopper. Samuel responds the latter, and leaves with Sanji. As they walk 
        away, Sanji asks what Samuel's plan is for this world, and how much Charles knows. 
        Samuel informs Sanji that while Charles is also from another dimension, he was 
        unaware of the world before coming to it. As for Samuel's plans, he repeats a 
        modified quote of Roger "Wealth, Fame, Power, I want to see everything this world 
        has to offer." 
      </p>
      <h3>The Town of the Ending</h3>
      <p>
        Luffy collides with Buggy on his way to the executioners platform, and gets 
        directions without either man recognizing the other, at least not immidietly for 
        Buggy. Luffy climbs to the Top of the Executioners stand, and is yelled at to get 
        down by a marine when Buggy attacks him. Zoro, Sanji, Samuel, Charles, Usopp, Nami, 
        Kaya and Nojiko are present when they see Luffy smile, before he is saved by a bolt 
        of lightning. Samuel, who is standing next to Bartolomeo and Desire, cheers for his 
        captain. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Smoker and Tashigi arrive, with Luffy and Zoro going to fight them while Samuel and 
        Sanji fight Alvida and Buggy. During the fight, Samuel brings up Buggy's past as a 
        member of the Roger pirates, and questions him being this weak, as he's not using 
        Haki. Buggy states that he left the grand line to get away from that craziness. 
        Samuel offers Buggy an alliance, which he declines, leading to him and Alvida being
        knocked out. Soon after, Luffy and Zoro defeat their opponents, and meet Dragon. 
      </p>
