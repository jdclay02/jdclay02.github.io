        and host a funeral for Tharden Rockseeker, who's corpse they found. After resting, the party traveled through the old 
        entrance, figting of Stirges before clearing out the Old Guardroom and tha Assayers' Office. From these, the party passed 
        through a fungal cavern before arriving at a Starry Cavern that led them to the quarters of Mormesk the Wraith, who tasked 
        the party with slaying the Spectator in the Forge before returning for their reward. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once their dealing with Mormesk was complete, the party sleared out the smelter cavern, dealing with a Flameskull along 
        the way. From there, the party went and cleared out the mess hall, before scavenging the Storeroom and clearing the south 
        barracks. Using the barracks as a launching point, the party went and cleared the mine tunnels before coming across a pool 
        of dark water that held a wand of magic missiles. After looting the pool's skeleton, the party cleared out the North 
        barracks, which contained the reinforcements of the Black Spider.  
      </p>

        With most of the cave clear, the party converged on the Black Spider's base of operations. They first took out the 
        remaining doppleganger and the bugbear work crew (locating Gauntlet's of Ogre Power in the process) before sneaking into 
        the priests quarters and rescuing Nundro, the third Rockseeker brother. With Nundro secured, the party entered the Temple 
        of Dumathoin. Within the Temple, the party fought against Nezznar the Black Spider and his Giant Spider guards and slew
