        </p>
        <p>

        <h3 id="Background">Background</h3>
        <p>
          Archie was born in the Briss Kingdom, where he lived until he was Sixteen. When he was
          Sixteen, he moved to the West Blue to study at the Naval Academy until he met his first
          captain, Maxwell, and joined him in being a pirate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Archie was twenty-one, the crew made their first attempt to enter the grand line, where
          they were beaten down by a marine captain, however they managed to escape with no casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Archie was twenty-four, his crew attempted to raid a Marine Base, hoping to take revenge
          on the Marine Captain. However, they failed and the Captain who origionally defeated them had
          been promotted to Commodore and he destroyed Archies old crew, as well as captured Maxwell and
          the Navigator.
        </p>

        <h4 id="CresentMoon">Cresent Moon Arc</h4>
        <p>
          Archie was recruited to what would become the New Game Pirates in the City of Pantherport
          on Cresent Moon Island. They at first looked for ships in the city, but could only find
          fishing boats, so they attempted to leave and go to Rivermouth. On the way, they were attacked
          by panthers, and after defeating them, they were asked by the Mayor to deal with them for pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archie hid in the tree's while the crew found and confronted the Pantherman, and Archie nearly
          shot the Pantherman, but allowed the captain, Keek Frip to negotiate. They crew brought him
          back to Pantherport, where Pantherman was arrested, and the crew fled after accidentaly
          starting a war. Outside of town, they met a child, who they would later learn was Isaac,
          the Second Prince of the Island. Isaac payed them 500,000 for let him pal around with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew arrived in Rivermouth, and Archie joined Chad and Keek Frip in heading to the docks
          to find a ship. They eventually found one, the Whispered Vesper, which they arranged to buy
          for $4,000,000 beli. Afterwords, the three went to the Tavern to meet back up with Suresh and
          Sanjo. At the Tavern, Archie attempted to steal Suresh's vodka, but failed. They crew met a
          Marine who hired them to look into Long Jack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Crew headed into the Jungle, where Archie successfuly led them past the initial guards,
          until Suresh sneezed, and alerted a diffrent group of guards. Keek and Suresh were knocked
          unconsious, while Chad, Sanjo and Isaac were captured. Archie avoided capture by hiding in
          a tree. The crew would later meet with Long Jack, and agree to steal back a treasure he had
          sold to the royal family.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Crew was released, and they informed the Marines of Long Jack for the money. They then
          broke into the castle with the help of the Prince, and with his knowledge, they told the
          treasure, which turned out to be a Devil Fruit. The Crew would use the Box and their
          accumulated funds to buy a boat and leave.
        </p>
        <h4 id="ColiseumGames">Coliseum Games Arc</h4>
        <p>
          After two weeks of Travel, the crew arrived on Coliseum Island, fleeing from Long Jack after
          breaking their deal with him. They agreed to participate in Coliseum Challenges to make back
          some money, as theirs was depleated. During their second Challenge, Archie accidentaly killed
          a man by shooting him in the head. In their third challenge, Keek and Chad were knocked out.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making it to the middle class challenges, the crew went to look for the devil fruit
          encyclopedia, and found a man who had consumed the Nightmare Devil Fruit. After braving their
          fears, they met with him, and gave him ideas on how to train and control his powers, and in
          exchange, got the book, where they identified the Devil Fruit they possessed, the Nagi Nagi no
          Mi, or the Calm Calm Fruit. Archie would be given the Fruit, as it suited his fighting style
          the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          During their time on the Coliseum island, they would also meet another competitor, who seemed
          to possess a skill based Devil Fruit, as she gave Archie the ability to Juggle. After making
          it to High Class, the crew visited a store, where Archie bought a Wazamono-Grade Rapier, named
          the Kaiyonami, and upgraded his Armor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks after arriving on the island, the island was attacked by Long Jack. As the crew fled
          they were faced with the Gunsmith who had ratted them out to Long Jack the first time, and
          the crew defeated him and the group of pirates he was leading. After defeating him, Archie
          shot him in the head while the rest of the crew, and took his custom double-shot rifle. The
          crew would flee the Island.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Undermountain">Undermountain Arc</h4>
        <p>
          Archie would lead the Crew away from Coliseum Island, and they would eventually arrive on
          an uncharted island, where they would get dragged down by a whirl pool. While Archie managed
          to stay on the ship, Keek and Sanjo were knocked off. Eventually, the remaining crew found a
          small town, and Archie decided to stay back while Chad and Suresh explored the town.
        </p>
        <p>
          After signing up with a mining crew, Chad and Suresh got Archie, so they could look for Keek
          and Sanjo. The three decided to ignore they job they had signed up for, and hunted them down
          by themselves. After being attacked by Spiders, they found a train, which eventually lead them
          to a smaller mining outpost they had visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chad and Suresh were found by Steve the Miner they had signed up with, who led them to Keek
          and Sanjo. After the crew united, they met the Vibing Pirates who had allied with Keek and
          Sanjo in the underground forest. The Crew would agree to take Steve and fifty others to the
          surface, in exchange for their help in leaving the underground.
        </p>
        <p>
          While preparing to leave, Archie was in charge of getting food, so he robbed a bakery, and
          to cause a distraction, lit a match and tossed it in to blow it up. He would arrive back at
          the ship and load his bread aboard while Keek and Suresh returned with the dingy that had been
          stolen from them by the fishermen. The crew would scout out the tunnels before returning
          to pick up Steve and his Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          While picking up Steve and his Group, Archie would Man the Cannons, and shoot groups of
          soldiers who tried to prevent Steve's group from leaving. After Steve's Group was on the ship
          Archie navigated the ship away from the city, and towards the elevator, which they would
          use to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          After arriving at the surface, the crew would part with the Vibing Pirates and Steve's Miners
          who started to build a new town on the uninhabited island. As they were leaving, they decided
          to head to the Grand Line, and they learned that Long Jack was preventing all pirate crews
          from heading to the Grand Line until they were caught and brought to him.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Scraptrap">Scraptrap Arc</h4>
        <p>
          As the crew headed towards Scraptrap, the island closes to Reverse Mountain, to get a Log Pose
          and a Den Den Mushi. They were attacked by two sea kings, and the crew killed them without
          much difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they arrived on the island, they payed there way onto the island, and they headed to a bar
          where they learned that Log Poses were being restricted. The Crew met the Marine Captain,
          Captain Who, who had memory problems. After Chad and Suresh left the bar, Archie, Keek and
          Sanjo went to purchase a Den Den Mushi, and they bought two.

        <p>
          After meeting back up with Suresh, they went to look for Chad, and Sanjo was recognized. After
          some quick talking by Suresh, the Marines left Sanjo alone, and Archie begged Sanjo to be more
          discrete. After a few hours, they got a lead on Chad's location, and followed a tunnel to his
          location.

          One the crew arrived, Archie tried to scout, but Sanjo jumped the fence into an ambush. Archie
          took out the snipers, and the crew was wounded. Sanjo then charged into the Factory, and
          Archie hid in the back to provide supporting cover. Eventually, Keek and Sanjo both went down,
          and Suresh was heavily injured, so Archie broke his cover to draw fire from the Snipers so
          Suresh wouldn't get targeted. This worked, and after the second group was defeated, Sanjo was
          woken up, but Keek was found to be dead. Archie called for a retreat, with Suresh picking up
          Keek's body, and Archie blowing up the factory.

          While running away, they found Umioga the Musician, who helped them evade capture. After an
          hour, they found Chad Man, and held an impromtu vote to make him the new Captain. Archie
          tried to trick the Marine Captain into giving them passage, but was called out for being a
          pirate. The Marines attacked the New Game Pirates, which ended in Chad Man getting knocked
          unconsious, but Archie defeated Captain Who and killed his Lieutenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew managed to escape the Island and had a viking funeral for their old Captain. The crew
          explained their adventures to their new Musician, Umioga and learned his story. Archie gave
          Chad Man his sword, Kaiyonami, and the sword he took form the Lieutenant.

          While the rest of the crew fought against Jack, Archie and Umioga controlled the ship to fight
          against the two secondary ships of Jack's fleet, while the rest of the Party fought their way
          through the Jack Pirates main ship towards the captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the Secondary ships were down, Archie and Umioga joined the rest of the crew in fighting
          against the Giant Jack. After Jack was defeated, Archie helped loot the ship, before leading
          the crew up reverse Mountain.

          Archie led the crew towards Parkland at the request of the rest of the crew after meeting with
          Kermit and his crew. After the events of the Carnival, Archie snuck around and learned about
          the true purpose of the Carnival and informed the rest of his crew.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day, Archie led the rest of the crew in assaulting the main base of the bounty
          hunters on the island. Archie was nearly killed by the leader of the bounty hunters before
          the curse curse fruit user was killed. After the bounty hunters were defeated, Archie
          annouced the truth to the rest of the pirates before leaving.

        <h4 id="Perimus">Perimus Arc</h4>
        <p>
          Archie watched as the crew agreed to help in finding the missing crew members of a local woman
          who were lost in the sunken castle. Archie led the crew through the storm towards the sunken
          castle of Perimus, and helped in getting the crew into the castle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archie joined the rest of the crew in traveling up the castle and rescuing the members of the
          womans crew. Archie tried and failed to convince Starchild to join the crew before heading up
          the castle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archie was the one to turn off the storm once in the beacon control room.

        <p>
          Archie pulled the ship into Nanohana, and found a Poster and a Newspaper. After reading both,
          the crew decided to go to the bridge to attempt to collect the bounty on the bandits occupying
          the bridge. During the fighting, Umioga and Suresh were knocked unconsious. After the battle,
          Chad retired from being a pirate.

        <p>
          When the crew learned their ship had been impounded, at Alubarna, Archie voted to head there,
          rather than towards the carnival, but was outvoted. On the way to the carnival, the crew was
          attacked by a large purple worm. Once the worm was dead, Archie harvested it's poison. During
          the Rainbase Carnival, Archie helped take care of the T-Rex while the ape escaped, and saw
          Sir Crocodile kill the ape.
