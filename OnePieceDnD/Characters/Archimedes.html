        </p>
        <p>
          Archie can come off as callous to people who don't know him, as he doesn't have a problem

        <h3 id="Background">Background</h3>
        <p>
          Archie was born in the Briss Kingdom, where he lived until he was Sixteen. When he was
          Sixteen, he moved to the West Blue to study at the Naval Academy until he met his first
          captain, Maxwell, and joined him in being a pirate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Archie was twenty-one, the crew made their first attempt to enter the grand line, where
          they were beaten down by a marine captain, however they managed to escape with no casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Archie was twenty-four, his crew attempted to raid a Marine Base, hoping to take revenge
          on the Marine Captain. However, they failed and the Captain who origionally defeated them had
          been promotted to Commodore and he destroyed Archies old crew, as well as captured Maxwell and
          the Navigator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Archie was recruited to what would become the New Game Pirates in the City of Pantherport
          on Cresent Moon Island. They at first looked for ships in the city, but could only find
          fishing boats, so they attempted to leave and go to Rivermouth. On the way, they were attacked
          by panthers, and after defeating them, they were asked by the Mayor to deal with them for pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archie hid in the tree's while the crew found and confronted the Pantherman, and Archie nearly
          shot the Pantherman, but allowed the captain, Keek Frip to negotiate. They crew brought him
          back to Pantherport, where Pantherman was arrested, and the crew fled after accidentaly
          starting a war. Outside of town, they met a child, who they would later learn was Isaac,
          the Second Prince of the Island. Isaac payed them 500,000 for let him pal around with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew arrived in Rivermouth, and Archie joined Chad and Keek Frip in heading to the docks
          to find a ship. They eventually found one, the Whispered Vesper, which they arranged to buy
          for $4,000,000 beli. Afterwords, the three went to the Tavern to meet back up with Suresh and
          Sanjo. At the Tavern, Archie attempted to steal Suresh's vodka, but failed. They crew met a
          Marine who hired them to look into Long Jack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Crew headed into the Jungle, where Archie successfuly led them past the initial guards,
          until Suresh sneezed, and alerted a diffrent group of guards. Keek and Suresh were knocked
          unconsious, while Chad, Sanjo and Isaac were captured. Archie avoided capture by hiding in
          a tree. The crew would later meet with Long Jack, and agree to steal back a treasure he had
          sold to the royal family.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Crew was released, and they informed the Marines of Long Jack for the money. They then
          broke into the castle with the help of the Prince, and with his knowledge, they told the
          treasure, which turned out to be a Devil Fruit. The Crew would use the Box and their
          accumulated funds to buy a boat and leave.
